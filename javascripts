        <p>Welcome to my programming portfolio, where I will be displaying all my projects and work done throughout this whole semester. 
            I am excited to demonstrate my growth throughout this semester, and want to compare and contrast my coding skill before and after the classs.
        I am looking forward to continuing this class and moving on to the next level.</p>
